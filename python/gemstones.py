John has discovered various rocks. Each rock is composed of various elements, 
and each element is represented by a lower-case Latin letter from 'a' to 'z'. 
An element can be present multiple times in a rock. An element is called a gem-element 
if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks.

Given the list of N rocks with their compositions, display the number of gem-elements 
that exist in those rocks.
